1995 Ford F-350 Crew Cab XL - $5200 OBO (183/290/Springdale)
<p>
I'm selling my 1995 Ford F350 Crew Cab XL.  This is a work truck with 225,000
miles.  It has the V8 460/7.5 liter gas engine, 4WD, 5-speed manual
transmission, two fuel tanks, oversized tires and suspension to match,
back-end tow package and in-bed gooseneck trailer hitch, working A/C.  I
bought this truck for my wife, who's an antique dealer, so she could haul
furniture and our four kids.  Alas, she can't seem to learn a stick.  So this
truck has a new clutch and clutch master/slave cylinders.  Also has a new
battery and plug wires.
